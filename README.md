## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

Brief Summary 
* Since the start of the COVID crisis (for this project, I will say it starts in March 2020), the world has been more reliant on communication technologies. I am interesting in seeing how large technology companies' stock prices have performed throughout this pandemic. Specifically, I will be looking into the FAANG stock prices: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. I have used data from Yahoo Finance to see the prices from March 1, 2020 to October 15 2020. In this project, I explore how the FAANG stocks and Amazon's retail and AWS services maintain stability in this time of instability.

Research Question
* With the markets and economy negatively impacted by COVID, how have large technology companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google performed in comparison to each other and the stock market as a whole? Which stocks performed well and why?
